# Problem Statement :

The amount of small independent businesses are sharply declining due to a variety of issues such as limited resources, little outreach, and competition from large corporations. [1] According to The Institute For Local Self-Reliance between 1997 and 2012, the number of local retailers fell by 108,000.  Currently, there are apps like Yelp or Nextdoor that allow people to find local restaurants in their area; however, these businesses are often overshadowed by more larger businesses that have the resources to advertise and receive more ratings in the process. It is more important than ever to ensure local and small businesses are being protected and provided with resources to allow them to succeed to continue the promotion of entrepreneurship.
