# Problem :

Many local businesses are rapidly loosing customers, currently there are few
places dedicated to local businesses to be noticed. Platforms like Yelp and
Opentable allows users to find businesses, but these services don't solely focus
on local businesses and often only support the top rated businesses. Businesses
that are just starting or aren't as well known often end up failing because they
don't have enough customer outreach.

# Solution :

For our solution we are envisioning a website where businesses will have an account
where they will be able to post events, pictures, and promotions to a public feed.
Our solution both provides businesses a platform to post and create awareness to
users in the Seattle Area, as well as it provides consumers a platform to find and
support their local businesses.
